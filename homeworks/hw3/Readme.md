# Compare&Swap, Fetch&Increase, Sort, Swap:
Implement atomic compare and swap and atomic fetch and increment in LEGv8 (You MUST use atomic operations as discussed in class): 

1. Compare and swap: Given two memory addresses, swap their values if they are different. Otherwise, do nothing.

2. Fetch and increment: Retrieve data from a memory location, increment the value, and store back into memory.

In LEGv8, implement the following operations using atomic operations:

1. Given an array of 10 integers, sort them.

2. Given two arrays of 5 integers each, swap the values between the arrays.
