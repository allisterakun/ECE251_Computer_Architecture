# Collatz, Fibonacci:

1. The Collatz conjecture states that any number can be reduced to 1 by the following cycle. If the number is even, divide that number by 2 (i.e. n = n/2). If the number is odd, multiply that number by 3 and add 1. (i.e. n = 3*n + 1). Continue until you get 1. For this problem, write assembly code that will return the number of iterations of the loop it will take to reach 1 from the number 123. After running the program, I should be able to echo the return code and get the answer.

2. Write assembly code  that will return fib(10). The result should be the return code of the application, which I can echo after running the program.
