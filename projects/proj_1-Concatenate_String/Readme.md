# String Concatenation:

  For project #1, you will ask the user to input 2 strings and concatenate the two. Both strings will have at most 10 ASCII characters. You will ask the user to enter the first string after which they will hit enter. If the number of characters exceeds the 10 character limit, you will print an error and exit the program with a 21 error code. If the number of characters is less than 10 characters, you will ask them to enter another string. You will do the same check and error out if necessary. However, if the second string exceeds the character limit, you will exit with 22 return code.

You will then output the concatenated string to stdout and return an error code that consists of the total number of characters in the concatenated string.
